          <h1>Cycling</h1>
          <p>In many countries, the most commonly used vehicle for road transport is a utility bicycle. These have frames with
        relaxed geometry, protecting the rider from shocks of the road and easing steering at low speeds. Utility bicycles tend
        to be equipped with accessories such as mudguards, pannier racks and lights, which extend their usefulness on a daily
        basis. Since the bicycle is so effective as a means of transportation, various companies have developed methods of
        carrying anything from the weekly shop to children on bicycles. Certain countries rely heavily on bicycles and their
        culture has developed around the bicycle as a primary form of transport. In Europe, Denmark and the Netherlands have the
        most bicycles per capita and most often use bicycles for everyday transport.[8][9]
        
        Road bikes tend to have a more upright shape and a shorter wheelbase, which make the bike more mobile but harder to ride
        slowly. The design, coupled with low or dropped handlebars, requires the rider to bend forward more, making use of
        stronger muscles (particularly the gluteus maximus) and reducing air resistance at high speed.
        
        Road bikes are designed for speed and efficiency on paved roads. They are characterized by their lightweight frames,
        skinny tires, drop handlebars, and narrow saddles. Road bikes are ideal for racing, long-distance riding, and fitness
        training.

            <h1>Cricket</h1>
            <p>Cricket is a bat-and-ball game that is played between two teams of eleven players on a field, at the centre of which is
            a 22-yard (20-metre; 66-foot) pitch with a wicket at each end, each comprising two bails (small sticks) balanced on
            three stumps. Two players from the batting team, the striker and nonstriker, stand in front of either wicket holding
            bats, while one player from the fielding team, the bowler, bowls the ball toward the striker's wicket from the opposite
            end of the pitch. The striker's goal is to hit the bowled ball with the bat and then switch places with the nonstriker,
            with the batting team scoring one run for each of these swaps. Runs are also scored when the ball reaches the boundary
            of the field or when the ball is bowled illegally.<br>
            The fielding team aims to prevent runs by dismissing batters (so they are "out"). Dismissal can occur in various ways,
            including being bowled (when the ball hits the striker's wicket and dislodges the bails), and by the fielding side
            either catching the ball after it is hit by the bat but before it hits the ground, or hitting a wicket with the ball
            before a batter can cross the crease line in front of the wicket. When ten batters have been dismissed, the innings
            (playing phase) ends and the teams swap roles. Forms of cricket range from traditional Test matches played over five
            days to the newer Twenty20 format (also known as T20), in which each team bats for a single innings of 20 overs (each
            "over" being a set of 6 fair opportunities for the batting team to score) and the game generally lasts three to four
            hours.</p>
